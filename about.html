  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Jordi Nistal, a software engineer based at Barcelona.<br>
    I like photography, I love music and play the guitar in a band called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hummband/" target="_blank">Humm</a><br>

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    But my favourite thing is coding. I'm interested in software itself but also in the human interaction while creating software.
    I strongly believe in <b>TDD</b> and I use it everyday, and so far, the methodology that's been working better for me is <b>"Agile"</b>.

  <p>
    I spend most of my time working and I've been thinking about writting a blog for years.
    Now I've decided to start with it. I hope you find something interesting!
