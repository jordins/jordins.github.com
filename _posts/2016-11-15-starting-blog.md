I'm Jordi, a software engineer based at Barcelona.

In this blog I'll share you some of my learnings, thoughts and curiosities on development.
They are not meant to be impressive, but just things that can save time to people or can serve me as a self-reminder.
I work a lot with javascript, so you will find mostly things about Angular2 and NodeJs.
